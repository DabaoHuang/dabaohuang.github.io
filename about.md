<p class="message">
    My name is Dabao Huang and I currently work as a DevOps engineer for a company in Taipei. I also work a full-stack developer. When the workload gets overwhelming, I sometimes help out with project management. These days, my main focus is on streamlining processes, developing tools to meet the needs of our team, and maintaining our servers. Occasionally, I write about the situations I encounter and how I deal with them. Sometimes, I look back at the articles I wrote before and feel a bit embarrassed. The main purpose of this blog is to record the knowledge and technical skills I've learned, and I hope it can help those who come across it.
